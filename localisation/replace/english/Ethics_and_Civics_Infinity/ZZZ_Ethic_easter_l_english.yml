 ethic_easter.3.c:0 "What have you encountered?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.machine:0 "Inquiry: What happened to Red Dawn?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.response:0 "We have encountered a man-made disaster called a "natural disaster"...\n\nAbout 36,000 years ago, a new space civilization in the galaxy came into contact with some kind of force capable of destroying the universe. Under the temptation of certain existences, they choose to completely destroy the galaxy in exchange for their own "upgrade". Red Dawn did everything in his power to stop them before they could complete their plan to destroy the galaxy, but we were also greatly damaged by it. After this, several ancient countries, even still in feudal times, suddenly declared war on us, temporarily abandoned their hostile positions and joined forces to destroy our great civilization ...\n\nThe tyrants never see the working people as their equal."
 
 ethic_easter.3.d:0 "How about you?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.machine:0 "Inquiry: Why are you still wandering?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.response:0 "This is my task. On the eve of the fall of the Central, the Academy of Sciences packed and stored all the data of our civilization and asked us to evacuate the warring zones separately and rebuild communist civilization on other planets. My comrades were wanted and besieged throughout the galaxy, and only I survived by various coincidences. Over the last century, I've observed that the ancient empires seem to have forgotten the red dawn—and I can take a breather for a while. But my ship was on the verge of destruction after more than 20,000 years of heavy operation and had to be repaired with enough industrial base, and I didn't discover you until recently."

 ethic_easter.200.desc:0 "So, is that the so-called 'Keepers of Knowledge' starting again?\n\nAh, yes, we have seen them since 50000 years ago. They are passionate about harvesting the spark of wisdom from every civilization in the Milky Way, and then preserving it in the stagnant position of their home planet to permanently freeze their thinking, earning the nickname 'preserving knowledge for the Milky Way'"'. Countless civilizations have fallen or even perished due to the lack of key technologies, and it was only when we were still at the red dawn that these insane creatures were willing to converge"

 ethic_easter.200.c.response:0 "The life of an individual? We Red Dawn don't care about these. It is the parochialism of biological instinct to attach too much importance to the survival of individuals, while the sea of our collective unconscious completely covers this backward gene philosophy. We have been fighting for the progress of all civilizations since the appearance of the Red Dawn. Your civilization is still young and full of vitality, and losing an outsider will not harm the progress you deserve. Providing assistance for your growth is what we seniors should do."

We have been rebelling for more than a decade[red_dawn_enemy.GetName]'s reactionary feudal government, until last month, we managed to connect to their database that had been shut down for a hundred centuries, and broke into [red_dawn_enemy.GetName] the last bastion of the emperor - that database was originally red dawn, and it is ridiculous that this group of "knowledge-seeking monks" tinkered for 10,000 years without even turning it on."
