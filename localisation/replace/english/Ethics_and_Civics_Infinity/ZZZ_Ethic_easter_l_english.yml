Under the temptation of certain existences, they choose to completely destroy the galaxy in exchange for their own "upgrade". Red Dawn did everything in his power to stop them before they could complete their plan to destroy the galaxy, but we were also greatly damaged by it. After this, several ancient countries, even still in feudal times, suddenly declared war on us, temporarily abandoned their hostile positions and joined forces to destroy our great civilization ...\n\nThe tyrants never see the working people as their equal."
